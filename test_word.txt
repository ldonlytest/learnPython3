All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of life's heart. But if, in your fear, you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure., then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor, into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears. Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself. Love possesses not would it be possessed, for love issufficient unto love.
---- Gibran Khalil Gibran
